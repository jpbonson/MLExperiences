Machine Learning Playground
=============
I use this github project to store quick and dirty ML projects, so the code is a mess.

ClassificationPlayground:
  - BioinformaticsProject: Use SVM and tree algorithms from the sklearn library to classify data extracted from biophysical simulations. Includes preprocessing and feature selection (Python).

ClusteringPlayground:
  - TextClustering: Test various preprocessing and clustering methods for textual data using the libraries sklearn, gensim, nltk and scipy (Python).

EvolutionaryPlayground:
  - PaperSummarizer: Use NLP and genetic algorithms to summarize scientific papers (Java).
